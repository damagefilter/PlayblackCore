        * This method gives the underlying BT a little amount of time to run.
        * <p>
        * Initially, a IBTExecutor is created to run a particular BT (ModelTask).
        * From then on, the <code>tick()</code> method is called to make the tree
        * evolve.
        * <p>
        * Usually the AI of a game is driven by ticks, which means that
        * periodically the AI is given some time to update its state (it checks the
        * current game state and performs some actions). BTs follow this pattern,
        * so whenever they are ticked, they are given a little amount of time to
        * think and behave as expected. If BTs are not ticked, they do not consume
        * CPU time and they not evolve.
        * <p>
        * By calling this method, the underlying BT will be ticked, so it will
        * think and evolve accordingly.
        * <p>
        * Note that ticking a tree that has already finished should have no effect
        * on the tree.
